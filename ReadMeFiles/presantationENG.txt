Hello Everyone,

I am excited to share some great news about me with you all! I have completed my first console game written in C language, and I am proudly presenting it to you. 🎮

This game marks an important milestone in my coding journey, with every step being a significant learning experience. Every line of code within the game was written with dedication and patience, and I am truly pleased with the outcome.

The game itself is quite simple: "Daring Escape". But this simplicity is just the beginning of my quest to enhance my coding skills and understanding of logic.

Sharing this experience with all of you brings me immense joy.

Wishing you days filled with the passion for coding 👨‍💻
